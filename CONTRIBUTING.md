Commit guidelines:

1. Commit titles should be clear and descriptive, summarizing the change made.
2. Commit descriptions should provide more detailed information about the change and the reason for it.
3. Commits should be small and focused, with one commit per logical change.
4. Commit messages should be written in present tense and imperative mood, e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".
5. Commits should avoid unnecessary information or comments not related to the changes made.
6. Commits should follow a consistent style and format.
7. Commits should reference any relevant issues or pull requests.

Issue Tracking:

Use issue tracking to manage and prioritize bugs, enhancements, and tasks related to the project. This can be done by creating and assigning issues in the repository, which can be tagged with relevant labels and milestones to help organize and prioritize them. Team members can then discuss and prioritize issues and assign them to specific individuals for resolution. By using issue tracking effectively, the team can keep track of outstanding tasks, work more efficiently, and ensure that bugs and issues are addressed in a timely manner.
