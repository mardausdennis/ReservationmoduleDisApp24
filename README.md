## Background and Objectives
The primary objective of this diploma thesis is to develop a resource reservation module for the Android app DisApp24. The app was launched as a beta version by Pod2Brain for small and medium-sized enterprises to facilitate their entry into digitization. The app already offers the possibility to display and configure custom RSS feeds. With the integration of the reservation module, efficient appointment scheduling should be enabled for both customers and providers, which is easy to use and multilingual.

## Project Scope
The resource reservation module is expected to achieve the following objectives:

### Customer's Perspective
Customers should be able to:
- select and request an appointment using the app
- enter their first and last name, contact information, and optional comments
- receive a notification when their appointment is confirmed or rejected
- view their appointments under "My Appointments"

### Provider's Perspective
Providers should be able to:
- process requests through a website that displays all Google Calendar-synchronized appointments in a list
- easily confirm or reject requested appointments
- receive a notification when an appointment is requested
- edit confirmed or open appointments with just one click

Appointment scheduling is done through a synchronized calendar that excludes already reserved time slots. The request requires the customer to enter their first and last name, contact information, and optional comments. Providers, on the other hand, receive an overview of all confirmed and open appointments on their website, which they can easily edit with just one click. After making a decision, customers receive a notification through the app and can view their appointments under "My Appointments".

The project includes the creation of a frontend and backend, as well as the integration of the Google Calendar API. In addition, a website will be created to display and confirm appointments.

## Team Members and Roles
The project team consists of three members, each taking on individual tasks within the overall project:

- D. Mardaus: UI/UX, self-service technologies, digitization of small businesses, Xamarin
- K. Koller: Google API integration, authentication and security, backend technologies, backend logic
- L. Ivos: data protection, app Google Play Store, customer recovery with push notifications + emails and bonuses, testing

Clear assignment of tasks and responsibilities within the team ensures that each task is professionally and purposefully addressed.

## App Functionalities and Characteristics
DisApp24 is an innovative Android app that makes it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to enter the world of digitization.
