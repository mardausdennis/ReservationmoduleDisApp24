Commit guidelines:

1. Commit titles should be clear and descriptive, summarizing the change made.
2. Commit descriptions should provide more detailed information about the change and the reason for it.
3. Commits should be small and focused, with one commit per logical change.
4. Commit messages should be written in present tense and imperative mood, e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".
5. Commits should avoid unnecessary information or comments not related to the changes made.
6. Commits should follow a consistent style and format.
7. Commits should reference any relevant issues or pull requests.
